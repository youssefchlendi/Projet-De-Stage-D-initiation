# Projet-De-Stage-D-initiation
## Introduction
This is my first `irl` project, It's the final product of `Four weeks internship` at tunvita in web development.
Where i developed a **Front&Back** end `Magazine` website.
### 1. Front-end
This website contains a visual description of **TIJARA** which is a managment and billing web application.
### 2. Back-end
#### 1. Contact service 
Using PHPMailer i was able to send a verification mail to the client and a mail to Contact service.
#### 2. Admin service
##### 1. Admin platform
In this platform an admin can reply to, read,delete any mail sent by clients through the contact form.
##### 2. Authentification
In order to access the **Admin platform** and admin must authentificate, I developped a simple authentification mechanism that it includes both registration and login.
